Retention Period Configuration:
•	As a customer, I want to set my database backup retention period within a valid range of 1 to 35 days. I want to be able to conduct PITR during my retention period.
•	As a customer, I need clear error messages when setting a retention period outside the valid range, so I understand my configuration mistakes and can correct them without confusion.
•	As a customer, I want to adjust the retention period settings as I need. I want to make sure these changes reflect for my system snapshots and PITR abilities.
 
Retention Period Enforcement and Data Restoration:
•	As a customer, I need to ensure that I can perform point-in-time restores within my defined retention period so that I can recover from data loss effectively.
•	As a customer, I expect automated backups to be purged after the defined retention period to maintain storage efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
•	As a customer, I want to verify the data consistency and integrity of my database when performing a point-in-time restore within the retention period, ensuring no data corruption has occurred.

Retention Period Impact on Operations:
•	As a customer, I need to ensure that when I change my retention period settings, it doesn't affect the availability and reliability of point-in-time restores during transition periods.
•	As a customer, I want to be able to change retention period settings multiple times and still perform accurate point-in-time restores, ensuring that the system's flexibility doesn't compromise data restoration capabilities.

Billing and Usage Monitoring:
•	As a customer, I want my storage usage and billing to accurately reflect any changes I make to the retention period, allowing me to manage my costs effectively.
•	As a customer, I expect all retention-related events to be correctly logged and monitorable, giving me visibility and auditability for compliance and management purposes.

Manual Snapshot Management:
•	As a customer, I want manual snapshots to be unaffected by changes in the automated backup retention period, preserving my longer-term backups regardless of automated settings.
