Retention Period Setting Verification Tests List

Verify that the retention period can be set to a valid range (1 to 35 days) without any errors.
Verify that setting a retention period outside the valid range (less than 1 day or more than 35 days) results in an appropriate error message.
Point-in-Time Restore Within Retention Period

Create data backups and perform point-in-time restores within the defined retention period to ensure successful restoration.
Point-in-Time Restore Outside Retention Period

Attempt a point-in-time restore beyond the defined retention period and validate that it fails with an appropriate error message.
Retention Period Adjustment Impact

Adjust the retention period settings (both increasing and decreasing) and verify that point-in-time restore functionality adheres to the new retention period setting.
Automated Backup Deletion

Verify that automated backups are automatically deleted after the retention period has elapsed, and cannot be restored.
Data Consistency After Restore

Perform a point-in-time restore within the retention period and verify the data consistency and integrity of the restored database with the source database at the point of the restore time.
Restoration Across Different Retention Period Settings

Change the retention period settings multiple times and perform point-in-time restores to various points within different retention periods to ensure consistent functionality.
Billing and Usage

Verify that storage usage and billing accurately reflect the changes made to the retention period settings.
Restoration During Retention Period Change

Initiate a point-in-time restore while simultaneously changing the retention period settings, and validate the impact (if any) on the restore process.
Event Logging and Monitoring

Verify that all point-in-time restore events (successful or failed) are correctly logged and can be monitored through the AWS Management Console or AWS CloudWatch, especially concerning retention period settings and changes.
Retaining Snapshots Beyond Retention Period

Verify the functionality and limitations of manual snapshots for retaining data backups beyond the automated backup retention period.
Impact on Snapshots

Verify that changing the retention period does not inadvertently delete manual snapshots created during the previous retention period settings.
