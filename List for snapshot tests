Snapshot Management:
•	As a customer, I want my snapshots to be created successfully without any errors and contain all the necessary data so that I am assured of reliable backups.
•	As a customer, I need to be able to delete snapshots to manage my storage costs and ensure that once deleted, the snapshots are irretrievable for data security.
•	As a customer, I want to set up automatic snapshots so that they are created at specific intervals, ensuring my data backup process is timely and consistent.
•	As a customer, I want to be able to copy snapshots successfully across regions to manage geographic redundancy and data availability.
•	As a customer, I want to share my snapshots with other AWS accounts to collaborate and share data securely and efficiently.

Snapshot Security and Compliance:
•	As a customer, I want to ensure that my snapshots are encrypted with the specified keys. I want to make sure my encrypted snapshots can be restored successfully.
•	As a customer, I want to define and manage my snapshot retention policies. I want to make sure that my backup retention schedules are automatically maintained according to my needs.

Snapshot Performance and Integrity:
•	As a customer, I expect the creation and restoration of snapshots to meet performance requirements, minimizing downtime and service interruption.
•	As a customer, I want to verify that the integrity of my snapshots is maintained, ensuring that after restoration, my data is not corrupted and retains its original quality.
•	As a customer, I expect restored snapshots to maintain data consistency, including schema and actual data, so that I can trust the backups are a true reflection of my original dataset.

Snapshot Monitoring and Maintenance:
•	As a customer, I want to be able to monitor and log snapshot events accurately to maintain oversight of my backup processes through AWS CloudWatch.
•	As a customer, I need to confirm that the size and storage consumption of my snapshots are accurate and efficient, ensuring I'm not using more resources than necessary.
•	As a customer, I expect snapshot billing to reflect actual usage so that I can manage my expenses effectively.

Snapshot Limitations and Compatibility:
•	As a customer, I need to know the limits on snapshot creation per region and receive appropriate error messages when these limits are exceeded to manage my backup strategy within AWS constraints.
•	As a customer, I want to ensure compatibility of snapshots across different versions of Aurora, confirming that snapshots from older versions are restorable in newer versions without issues.

Snapshot Accessibility and Usability:
•	As a customer, I want an easy-to-use interface to manage my snapshots, including clear options for creation, restoration, and deletion, to streamline my workflow and reduce the need for extensive technical support.
